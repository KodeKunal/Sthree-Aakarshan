# Sthree Aakarshan — Store Website

A fast, modern store website built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It includes essential pages: Home, About, Products, and Contact.

## Features
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS styling
- React Router (SPA navigation)
- SEO-friendly `index.html` with meta tags

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — Start local dev server
- `npm run build` — Type-check + build for production
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

## Customize Content
- Update text in `src/pages/*` and `src/components/*`.
- Site title and meta in `index.html`.
- Colors and theme in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Notes
- Placeholder images are solid gradients—replace with real photos later (e.g., in `ProductGrid`).
- The contact form is a demo only; wire it to your preferred form backend or service if needed.
